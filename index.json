However, these methods tend to be much slower than the popular iterative closest point (ICP) algorithms, which severely limits their usability. In this paper, we contribute a novel probabilistic registration method that achieves state-of-the-art robustness as well as substantially faster computational performance than modern ICP implementations. This is achieved using a rigorous yet computationally-efficient probabilistic formulation. Point-set registration is cast as a maximum likelihood estimation and solved using the EM algorithm. We show that with a simple augmentation, the E step can be formulated as a filtering problem, allowing us to leverage advances in efficient Gaussian filtering methods. We also propose a customized permutohedral filter~\\cite{adams2010permu} for improved efficiency while retaining sufficient accuracy for our task. Additionally, we present a simple and efficient twist parameterization that generalizes our method to the registration of articulated and deformable objects. For articulated objects, the complexity of our method is almost independent of the Degrees Of Freedom (DOFs). %, which makes it highly efficient even for high DOF systems. The results demonstrate the proposed method consistently outperforms many competitive baselines on a variety of registration tasks.","tags":null,"title":"FilterReg: Robust and Efficient Probabilistic Point-Set Registration using Gaussian Filter and Twist Parameterization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wei Gao","Russ Tedrake"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1519862400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1519862400,"objectID":"ebba17dc744665abd2c0e69682a6da3f","permalink":"https://weigao95.github.io/publication/rss18/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rss18/","section":"publication","summary":"We contribute a dense SLAM system that takes a live stream of depth images as input and reconstructs non-rigid deforming scenes in real time, without templates or prior models. In contrast to existing approaches, we do not maintain any volumetric data structures, such as truncated signed distance function (TSDF) fields or deformation fields, which are performance and memory intensive. Our system works with a flat point (surfel) based representation of geometry, which can be directly acquired from commodity depth sensors. Standard graphics pipelines and general purpose GPU (GPGPU) computing are leveraged for all central operations, i.e., nearest neighbor maintenance, non-rigid deformation field estimation and fusion of depth measurements. Our pipeline inherently avoids expensive volumetric operations such as marching cubes, volumetric fusion and dense deformation field update, leading to significantly improved performance. Furthermore, the explicit and flexible surfel based geometry representation enables efficient tackling of topology changes and tracking failures, which makes our reconstructions consistent with updated depth observations. Our system allows robots maintain a scene description with non-rigidly deformed objects that potentially enables interactions with dynamic working environments.","tags":null,"title":"SurfelWarp: Efficient Non-Volumetric Dynamic Reconstruction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wei Gao","Liting Sun","Masayoshi Tomizuka"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1488326400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1488326400,"objectID":"35aa3d320908dc20f6708227c5a9101c","permalink":"https://weigao95.github.io/publication/cdc17/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cdc17/","section":"publication","summary":"The idea of using multiple models to cope with parameter uncertainties in adaptive systems was first introduced in the 1990s. Conventionally, methods based on this mechanism typically suffer from “curse of dimension,” which means that the number of required identification models grows exponentially with respect to the number of unknown parameters. In this paper, the parameter identification problem is formulated as a time-varying optimization procedure, and a guided multiple model search framework is proposed to solve it. Instead of sampling the identification models in a large parameter space, models are sampled locally and used to estimate the search direction. As a result, the number of needed identification models grows linearly in this approach, in comparison with the exponential growth of existing methods. The proposed method also provides a unified form for nonlinear systems with non-affine unknown parameters, which is out of the scope of classical adaptive control theory. Moreover, theoretical convergence analysis is provided with specific conditions. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified by simulations and comparisons with existing methods.","tags":null,"title":"A Guided Search Framework in Multiple Model Control","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yongxiang Fan*","Wei Gao*","Wenjie Chen","Masayoshi Tomizuka"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1488326400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1488326400,"objectID":"cf277d16d7b59e549302586d19503246","permalink":"https://weigao95.github.io/publication/ifac17/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ifac17/","section":"publication","summary":"Dexterous manipulation has broad potential applications in assembly lines, warehouses and agriculture, and so on. To perform large-scale, complicated manipulation tasks, a multi-fingered robotic hand sometimes has to sequentially adjust its grasping status, i.e. the finger gaits, to deal with the workspace limits and object stability. However, realizing finger gaits planning in dexterous manipulation is challenging due to the involved hybrid dynamics, complicated grasp quality metrics, and uncertainties during the finger gaiting. In this paper, a dual-stage optimization based controller is proposed to handle these challenges. First, a velocity-level finger gaits planner is introduced by combining object grasp quality with hand kinematic limitations. The proposed finger gaits planner is computationally efficient and can be solved in real-time. Second, a manipulation controller using force optimization is presented. To deal with mass uncertainties and external disturbances, a modified impedance control is integrated into the manipulation controller. The dual-stage controller does not require the shape of the object, nor does it rely on expensive 3D/6D tactile sensors. Simulation results verify the efficacy of the proposed dual-stage controller.","tags":null,"title":"Real-Time Finger Gaits Planning for Dexterous Manipulation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yongxiang Fan","Liting Sun","Minghui Zheng","Wei Gao","Masayoshi Tomizuka"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1485907200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1485907200,"objectID":"3156b2fc98fd5f55a7d5b95239821b3f","permalink":"https://weigao95.github.io/publication/aim17/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/aim17/","section":"publication","summary":"Dexterous manipulation has broad applications in assembly lines, warehouses and agriculture. To perform broad-scale manipulation tasks, it is desired that a multi-fingered robotic hand can robustly manipulate objects without knowing the exact objects dynamics (i.e. mass and inertia) in advance. However, realizing robust manipulation is challenging due to the complex contact dynamics, the nonlinearities of the system, and the potential sliding during manipulation. In this paper, a dual-stage grasp controller is proposed to handle these challenges. In the first stage, feedback linearization is utilized to linearize the nonlinear uncertain system. Considering the structures of uncertainties, a robust controller is designed for such a linearized system to obtain the desired Cartesian force on the object. In the second stage, a manipulation controller regulates the contact force based on the Cartesian force from the first stage. The dual-stage grasp controller is able to realize robust manipulation without contact modeling, prevent the slippage, and withstand 40% mass and 50% inertia uncertainties. Moreover, it does not require velocity measurement or 3D/6D tactile sensor. Simulation results on Mujoco verify the efficacy of the proposed method.","tags":null,"title":"Robust Dexterous Manipulation under Object Dynamics Uncertainties","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wei Gao","Zhenzhong Jia","Chenglong Fu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1467331200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1467331200,"objectID":"a4c6f290527e5fb35851cdc62a28d5e6","permalink":"https://weigao95.github.io/publication/robotica_17/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/robotica_17/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper investigates the active vertical motion of biped systems and its significance to the balance of biped robots, which have been commonly neglected by the use of a well-known model called the Linear Inverted Pendulum Model. The feasible step location is theoretically estimated by considering the active vertical movement on a simple point mass model. Based on the estimation, we present two new strategies, namely the flexion strategy and the extension strategy, to enable biped robots to restore balance through active upward and downward motions. The analytical results demonstrate that the robot is able to recover from much larger disturbances using our proposed methods. Simulations of the simple point mass model validate our analysis. Besides, prototype controllers that incorporate our proposed strategies have also been implemented on a simulated humanoid robot. Numerical simulations on both the simple point mass model and the realistic humanoid model prove the effectiveness of proposed strategies.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Increase the Feasible Step Region of Biped Robots through Active Vertical Flexion and Extension Motions","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"https://weigao95.github.io/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"An example of linking directly to an external project website using `external_link`.","tags":["Demo"],"title":"External Project","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
